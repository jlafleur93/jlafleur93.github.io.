I've spent the majority of today reinstalling ruby, as it had issues installing to a more current version  to support jekyll and get this inactive domain finally doing something. 

I guess this website will just be a bunch of small updates and progressess, as I traverse the world. 

I was able to finally get my ruby version to switch after uninstalling ruby via brew, and following the steps in this [gist].

Thanks [Andrew Roycarter]!
