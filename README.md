### About

Junior Web Developer transition from Computer technician. Working as a computer tech taught me the love for the hardware and I knew I wanted to go deeper. What I love about web development is researching bugs and problems, finding solutions is satisfying!  Once you get through one problem the next seems to make more sense. I enjoy creating easy to use products that are a seamless interaction for the customer.
